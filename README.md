# Blockchain Dungeon Crawler

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a blockchain-based dungeon crawler game that combines the simplicity and procedural generation of NetHack with the visual style and immersive experience of Old School RuneScape (OSRS). This document outlines the steps and strategies to achieve this vision.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: Manages game logic, blockchain interactions, and server-side operations.
- **Frontend**: Handles the user interface and game rendering using Phaser.
- **Assets**: Contains game assets such as sprites and configuration files.

## Key Features

1. **Procedural Generation**: 
   - Use blockchain data to influence dungeon generation.
   - Implement a grid-based map similar to NetHack.

2. **Visual Style**:
   - Simplify assets to match the 2D aesthetic of OSRS.
   - Use pixel art for characters and items.

3. **Blockchain Integration**:
   - Store game state and player progress on the blockchain.
   - Use blockchain for unique item generation and trading.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Simplify Assets

- **Objective**: Create a consistent 2D pixel art style.
- **Action**: 
  - Replace current high-resolution assets with pixel art.
  - Use tools like Aseprite for asset creation.

### 2. Procedural Dungeon Generation

- **Objective**: Generate dungeons using blockchain data.
- **Action**:
  - Develop algorithms to create random dungeon layouts.
  - Use blockchain data as seeds for randomness.

### 3. Game Mechanics

- **Objective**: Implement core gameplay inspired by NetHack.
- **Action**:
  - Develop turn-based combat and exploration mechanics.
  - Implement inventory and item systems.

### 4. Blockchain Features

- **Objective**: Integrate blockchain for unique game features.
- **Action**:
  - Store player progress and items on the blockchain.
  - Enable trading of unique items between players.

### 5. User Interface

- **Objective**: Create an intuitive and engaging UI.
- **Action**:
  - Design a simple UI for inventory and character stats.
  - Use Phaser to render the game world and UI elements.

## Development Environment

- **Node.js**: Backend server and game logic.
- **Phaser**: Frontend game rendering.
- **PM2**: Process management for server applications.
- **Blockchain Platform**: Choose a suitable blockchain for integration.
